# Airplane-Crash-Simulation
Airplane Crash Simulation using OpenGL

# Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to display a graphic representation of the 9/11 airplane crash
on the World Trade Center in the USA using OpenGL. It mainly consists of four
frames namely: plane take-off, plane fly-by, plane flying towards twin towers and
plane crash on twin towers.

# Motivation
Computer graphics is an art of drawing pictures, lines, charts, etc. using computers
with the help of programming. The OpenGL transformations and the input
interactions add more to the graphics. This motivated me to build up this project to
create a graphic representation of the 9/11 attack

# Output

1. This screen displays airplane on the runway.
